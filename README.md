# Peace and Conflict Studies

This project is an exploratory and learning exercise for me. There's a number of components to it. By and large I am ultimately interested in doing a big text analysis project on a number of domains in the academic area, Peace and Conflict Studies. 

The project so far has involed:
* Building a webscraper to collect almost 50,000 journal articles from the Taylor and Francis Online repository according to 10 'search terms'. I ran this program firstly in June 2018, then in Aug-Sept to harvest articles for some more search terms
* What was returned was a mix of meta-data about the articles as well as the article abstract and full body text itself. I then put this into a Postgres database to ease in managing and query such a large corpus
* I am now starting to do some analysis, mostly descriptive so far. Next will come the text analysis, but compute power is proving a challenge.
* And communicating and publishing this on Binder using Jupyter Notebooks and Shiny apps. More [here](https://github.com/paddytobias/pc_publications_binder)
